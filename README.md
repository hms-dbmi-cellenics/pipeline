# Cellenics Pipeline

The Cellenics pipeline project for dependency-managed work processing.

## Getting started

The steps of the pipeline that are run through this project are started
spontaneously on your machine as Docker containers, simulating Kubernetes
in local development.

We have included a utility so you can automatically monitor containers spawned
and read their logs as they are executing.

For local development, you should already have Docker and Node.js installed, as well as
Inframock running.

Afterwards, you can install the pipeline dependencies with:

```bash
make install
```

To build and run the pipeline:

```bash
make build && make run
```

A similar message should appear:

```
> node src/app.js

Loading CloudFormation for local container launcher...
Creating mock Lambda function on InfraMock...
No previous stack found on InfraMock.
Stack with ARN arn:aws:cloudformation:eu-west-1:000000000000:stack/local-container-launcher/106d1df9 successfully created.
Waiting for Docker events...
```

Logs from pipelines run through the API will apear here.

## Rebuiling the docker images

```bash
make build
```

## Local development and adding dependencies

First make sure the project library is synchronized with the lockfile:

```R
# inside pipeline-runner folder
renv::restore()
```

**NOTE**: To restore Bioconductor packages your R version needs to be the same as in the [Dockerfile](pipeline-runner/Dockerfile) (4.0.5).

`install.packages(...)` and use them (e.g. `dplyr::left_join(...)`) as you normally would. Then, update the lockfile:

```R
renv::snapshot()
```

commit the changes to the lockfile (used to install dependencies in the Dockerfile). See [renv docs](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) for more info.



## Debugging locally

**TLDR**: save something inside `/debug` in a data processing or gem2s step to
 access it later from `./local-runner/debug`.

 **TLDR2**: if the pipeline throws an error, `tryCatchLog` will save a [dump file](https://github.com/aryoda/tryCatchLog#how-do-i-perform-a-post-mortem-analysis-of-my-crashed-r-script) in  `./local-runner/debug` that can be used for inspecting the workspace and object values along the call stack.

To save the parameters (`config`, `seurat_obj`, etc) to a **data processing** task function, specify `DEBUG_STEP`.
Available tasks include all task names listed in `run_processing_step` [init.R](pipeline-runner/init.R#L69) as well as `DEBUG_STEP=all` 
to save the parameters to all data processing task functions:

```bash
# e.g. DEBUG_STEP=dataIntegration
DEBUG_STEP=task_name make run
```

When the pipeline is run, it will save the parameters to the specified `task_name` in `$(pwd)/debug`. You
can load these into your R environment:

```R
# clicking the file in RStudio does this for you
load('{task_name}_{sample_id}.RData')

# if you need to load multiple tasks, you can load each into a seperate environment
# you would when access objects using e.g. task_env$scdata
task_env <- new.env()
load('{task_name}_{sample_id}.RData', envir = task_env)
```

## Troubleshooting

#### Linux Mint 20.3 Cinnamon
```bash
Error in curl::curl_fetch_memory(url, handle = handle) : 
Timeout was reached: [172.17.0.1:4566] Connection timeout after 60001 ms
Calls: init ... request_fetch -> request_fetch.write_memory -> <Anonymous>
Execution halted
```
Turn off firewall or allow incoming traffic. This would allow AWS to send packages to the pipeline, which would otherwise be blocked by the firewall.

1. Open *Firewall Configuration* from the Start Menu.
2. Select **Allow** in the **Outgoing** dropdown menu (Alternatively, set **Status** to OFF).
